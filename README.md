This is an academic project developed as part of a college assignment (FADERGS). The main objective was to create a simple web page featuring:
- a registration form for collecting user information (name, contact details and address);
- a dynamic list to display the registered users and options for edit and delete them.

The purpose of the project was to practice HTML and CSS for structure and styling, as well as PHP and SQL for back-end functionality and database management.
